      <div class="mission-text">
        <p>The organization of cultural events has frequently been used by the State of Israel to cleanse its international image and, consequently, whitewash its responsibility for the genocide.</p>

        <p>In the recent past, we have seen that the collective boycott of Zionist organizations has proven effective in destroying this whitewashing strategy. It serves as a warning to prevent similar situations from happening again. The Anta Gathering has been canceled. We all win – those who love electronic music, the local population, and above all, and most importantly – the palestinian people!</p>

        <p>A group of more than twenty people spread across the country—most of them involved in music—decided to join forces to create Liberation Station, which presents itself as a denunciation of any and all Zionist image-washing strategies through music; a humanitarian and entirely voluntary alternative with a strong commitment to raising funds for the cause at hand.</p>

        <p>Nine events will be held in five different locations from September 30th to October 5th. The entire program will be streamed, and most events will be held publicly.</p>

        <p>All proceeds will go to families in Gaza in need. We've identified four families in urgent need, and for every additional €100, we'll help one more.</p>

        <p>We're also partnering with Occupy For Gaza and Coimbra Pela Palestina.</p>
